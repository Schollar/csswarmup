                <h1>Homer Simpson</h1>
                <p>Homer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge, and father to Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.[1]
                    He is
                    the son of Mona and Abraham "Grampa" Simpson. Homer held over 188 different jobs in the first 400
                    episodes of The Simpsons.[2] In most episodes, he works as the nuclear safety inspector at the
                    Springfield Nuclear Power Plant (in Sector 7-G), a position which he has held since "Homer's
                    Odyssey",
                    the third episode of the series, despite the fact that he is totally unsuitable for it.</p>

                <h1>Bart Simpson</h1>
                <p>The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not age or age very little, and as
                    such, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have
                    been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent
                    episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in "I Married Marge" (season three, 1991) as being in the
                    early 1980s.[3] In "Simpsorama" (season 26, 2014) Bart states his birthday as February 23.</p>

                <h1>Lisa Simpson</h1>
                <p>Lisa is always depicted as 7â€“8 years old.[3] The show itself is perpetually set in the year of
                    broadcast (except for occasional flashbacks and flashforwards). In several episodes, events have
                    been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent
                    episodes.[4] Lisa's year of birth is given in "Lisa's First Word" (season 4, 1992) as 1984, during
                    the Summer Olympics.</p>
